  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>10.08.2025</strong></p>
  <p>These Terms of Service (the “<em>Terms</em>”) govern your access to and use of the web application <strong>Valorant Lineups</strong> (the “<em>Service</em>”), operated by <strong>Michał Cyran</strong> (“<em>we</em>”, “<em>us</em>”, or “<em>our</em>”).</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not access or use the Service.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
  <p><strong>"RSO"</strong> means Riot Sign-On (Riot's OAuth2-based authentication mechanism).<br>
     <strong>"User"</strong> or <strong>"you"</strong> means a person who accesses or uses the Service.<br>
     Capitalized terms not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in these Terms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Scope of the Service</h2>
  <p>The Service is a third-party web application that provides features related to VALORANT gameplay and statistics. The Service itself does not implement an independent account or password system. To verify that a person is the owner of a given Riot account and to obtain any Riot-provided account or gameplay data, the Service uses Riot Sign-On (RSO).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Riot Sign-On (RSO) and Data Access</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Mandatory RSO use.</strong> To access features that require verification of your Riot account, you must authenticate via Riot Sign-On (RSO). RSO is an OAuth2 flow operated by Riot Games and is used to obtain your consent to share Riot account or game-related data with the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope of data requested.</strong> We will only request access to the minimum Riot-provided data scopes necessary to operate the Service. The exact scopes and data requested will be presented to you during the RSO consent flow.</li>
    <li><strong>No credential collection.</strong> We will never ask you to provide your Riot username or password directly to this Service. All authentication is performed by Riot via RSO; we never store Riot account passwords.</li>
    <li><strong>Redirects, branding & URLs.</strong> As part of the RSO client registration you may be required to provide Riot with the URLs for this Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, and certain redirect/logout URLs for the OAuth flow. By using the Service you acknowledge that those URLs may be displayed to players in the RSO login UI.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Privacy & Data Handling</h2>
  <p>Our Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://lightios.github.io/PrivacyPolicies/ValorantLineupsWebPP.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>) describes what personal data we receive from Riot via RSO (if any), how we use it, and how long we retain it. In short:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We only receive and retain Riot-provided data that you explicitly consent to share via the RSO flow.</li>
    <li>We do not collect additional personal data through the Service unless explicitly stated in the Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li>If you request deletion of your data or unlink the Service from your Riot account via Riot (or via our contact address below), we will remove data we control in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>When using the Service you agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Attempt to access Riot accounts, services, or systems without authorization;</li>
    <li>Use the Service to harass, abuse, or infringe the rights of others;</li>
    <li>Interfere with the operation or security of the Service;</li>
    <li>Reverse engineer, modify, or attempt to discover any source code or proprietary systems of the Service, except to the extent permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All rights, title and interest in and to the Service, including its content, design, text, images, trademarks, and software are owned by us or our licensors. Nothing in these Terms grants you any rights to our intellectual property except for the limited rights to use the Service as explicitly described in these Terms. <strong>Riot Games</strong> and related marks are the property of Riot Games; your use of RSO and Riot data is subject to Riot’s developer policies and trademark rules.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Service may rely on third-party services (including Riot's APIs and RSO). Your use of third-party services is subject to the third parties’ terms, and we are not responsible for their conduct or availability.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free from harmful components.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability for direct damages shall not exceed the greater of (i) the total fees you have paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or (ii) USD 50. If you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that does not allow these limitations, they may not apply to you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for any reason, including if you breach these Terms or if Riot revokes our ability to access Riot data. On termination we may disable your access and/or delete data we control in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>12. Modifications to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example via the Service or by email). Continued use of the Service after the changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>13. Compliance with Riot Policies</h2>
  <p>Your access to Riot account information and gameplay data via the Service is governed by Riot’s developer policies and the RSO integration requirements. We will comply with Riot’s terms and developer policies and expect Users to comply where applicable. If Riot requires changes to our Service, we may be required to make them to retain RSO access.</p>
